# react-native-todo

React Native experimental

## Functional requirements

- The App must use React Native
- User must be able to enter new to-do items
- User must be able to see their to-do items
- User must be able to clear items that are done

## User stories reflecting functional requirements (must)

Requirements for end user goal

- As a user I want to have an input field where I can write text for new todos
- As a user I want to have a submit button so I can add the text as a todo on the todo list
- As a user I want new todos to be added to a list
- As a user I want the todo list to be displayed on my screen
- As a user I want to have a delete button on each todo so that I can remove todos
- As a user I want the todo to be removed when I click on the remove button

## User stories reflecting functional requirements (nice to have)

- As a user I don't want empty todos
- As a user I want to understand when I can and can not press the add button to add a todo

## Stack

- Built with Expo
- For sinplicity on Windows, use CMD or PowerShell instead of WSL or Git Bash

npx expo start
```
